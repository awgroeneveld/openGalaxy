This document describes how to compile openGalaxy on Raspbian.
==============================================================


Prerequisites for compiling openGalaxy:
---------------------------------------

The minimum version of Raspbian is 'jessie'

Please be aware that the Raspberry Pi is not very powerfull,
it has trouble running the graphical opengalaxy-client
application at full speed. Perhaps it will run better once
the application matures.

The server application (opengalaxy) and the certificate
manager (opengalaxy-ca) do not suffer from this.


Cross-compiling openGalaxy on a Debian or Ubuntu computer:
----------------------------------------------------------

tar xf opengalaxy-0.12.tar.xz
cd openagalaxy-0.12
mkdir build && cd build
../build-debs raspbian jessie armhf ../../opengalaxy-0.12.tar.xz

Note: I only tested this with Debian, Ubuntu should work...


Compiling openGalaxy (on the Raspberry Pi):
-------------------------------------------

sudo apt-get install devscripts
mv opengalaxy-0.12.tar.xz opengalaxy_0.12.orig.tar.xz
tar xf opengalaxy_0.12.orig.tar.xz
cd opengalaxy-0.12
debuild -us -uc

Note that the build-debs method should also work.
