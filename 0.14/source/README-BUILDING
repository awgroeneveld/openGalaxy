This document describes how to compile openGalaxy on Linux.
-----------------------------------------------------------

Note: For Windows compilation instruction see the file README-MSYS2.TXT
      For the Raspberry Pi see README.RaspberryPi


Prerequisites for compiling openGalaxy:
---------------------------------------

 - libmysqlclient is needed only if the MySQL output plug-in is used.
   (http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/c/)

   I build my copy with the following command (from the source directory):

   cmake . && make && sudo make install

   Alternativly you could install the libmysqlclient provided by your
   Linux distribution. On Debian GNU/Linux this can be done with:

   sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev


 - The opengalaxy-ca program uses the OpenSSL commandline utility.
   On Linux, it is not installed from the source package openGalaxy build,
   instead opengalaxy-ca relies on the openssl executables installed by
   your distro.
   On Windows, the OpenSSL executable is distrubuted together with openGalaxy.

 - opengalaxy-ca and opengalaxy-client require GTK+ (3.x), the build scripts
   assume the GTK+ libraries and its dependencies are available in the
   build environment.

 - The make process will download libwebsockets and openssl (if so selected)
   from Github. If you have no internet connection or want to use a specific
   version of either library, then you can place their sourcecode the
   'libwebsockets' and/or 'openssl' directories inside the build directory
   before running make.

Note:
The code of openGalaxy is multithreaded and uses the POSIX Threads library
(available by default on most modern Linux distributions).

Note:
These dependencies are fullfilled automaticly when building* or installing
Debian packages (* using pbuilder).


Compilation of openGalaxy:
--------------------------

  On Debian GNU/Linux:
 ----------------------

Execute these commands:

tar xf opengalaxy-0.12.tar.xz
cd openagalaxy-0.12
mkdir build && cd build

Followed by (debian):
../build-debs debian jessie amd64 ../../opengalaxy-0.12.tar.xz

Or (ubuntu)
../build-debs ubuntu trusty amd64 ../../opengalaxy-0.12.tar.xz



  On other Linux:
 -----------------

tar xf opengalaxy-0.12.tar.xz
cd openagalaxy-0.12
mkdir build && cd build

followed by:

../configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var [--enable-debug] [other options to configure script]

And if there are no errors:

make && sudo make install


Note:
 This also works on Debian/Ubuntu if you don't want to buidl an entire package.

Note:
 The configure script has several options that may assist in compiling
 openGalaxy on your target. You can list them with the command:

 ../configure --help
