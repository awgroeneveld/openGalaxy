2016-04-19  Version 0.14

   - Much better authentication than 'http basic auth'
   - Better encryption method for embedded certificate data (allows for more data)
   - The server now starts in http mode if not all SSL certificates are found.
   - Added the ability to upload certificates to a running server.
   - Changed file extention of exported client certificates (.p12 -> .pfx)
   - Added some http headers to prevent caching of some files by the web browser.
   - Disabled HTTP2/ALPN (for now) as it is marked experimental in libwebsockets.
   - Updated Jquery to 2.2.3 and Jquery UI to 1.11.4
   - Some UI fixes in the webinterface
   - No longer distribute libwebsockets and openssl in the source package
     (they are cloned from github during the build instead).
   - New documentation for the certificate manager.


2016-03-22  Version 0.13

   - Added the option to ask for a username/password (in addition to a certificate).
   - Added session support (using server redirects).
   - Support for automatic logoff after timeout (not perfect yet so disabled by default).
   - Combined the two websocket protocols implemented by openGalaxy into a single protocol
     for both SIA messages and the commands send to the panel.
   - Bugfix: The windows installer no longer overwrites passphrase.txt
   - Completely removed support for wolfSSL (it may or may not return in a future version).
   - Upgraded to libwebsockets 1.7.4 and openssl 1.0.2g
   - Windows Bugfix: Misconfiguration of the serialport caused SerialPort::read() to
     eat any bytes with a 0 value.


2016-02-18  Version 0.12.1
   - Windows Hotfix: opengalaxy (server) crashed when not using SSL.
     This patch fixes this issue.


2015-07-12  Version 0.12

   - Added 'build-debs' script to build .deb packages for Debian and possibly Ubuntu.
     It can also cross-compile for Raspbian (Raspberry Pi 2).
   - Added Windows 64bit support
   - opengalaxy: Complete re-write of the server application in C++11.
   - opengalaxy: Switched the default SSL provider back to OpenSSL (for now).
   - opengalaxy: Added a new output plugin: Write SIA messages to a text file.
   - opengalaxy: Blacklist the originating IP address for 1 minute after a failed login.
     This also generates an illigal code alarm on the connected panel.
   - opengalaxy: Added new actions 'SET' and 'PARAMETER' to the 'ZONE' command.
     With these you can set the part-set and soak-test parameters of a zone
     or set a (virtual) zone's state to open, closed or tamper.
   - opengalaxy: Added the new ZONE actions to the webinterface.
   - opengalaxy: Added a new command 'CODE-ALARM' that generates an
     illigal code alarm on the panel.
   - opengalaxy: Linux: Sending a SIGHUP signal will restart the server,
     reloading all settings and certificates/crl.
   - Bugfix: opengalaxy-ca: server certificate:
     Add the CN as the first item in subjectAltName, this fixes a 'cert not
     issued by CN' error when the cert is validated in a webbrowser running
     on another machine in the network.
   - Bugfix: opengalaxy-ca:
     - Display all alternative dns/ip names for an existing server cert.
     - On the client tab, name and surname entries may now contain whitespaces.
   - opengalaxy-ca: Always use the openssl executeable in our installation directory. (windows)
   - opengalaxy-client: no new features in this release.
   - opengalaxy-client: Bugfix: reduced a timer speed that resulted in high cpu useage.


2015-07-12  Version 0.11

   - Debianized openGalaxy, building debian packages is now possible.
   - Changed the name of the sourcecode archive (galaxy-[version].tar.xz -> opengalaxy-[version].tar.xz)
   - Changed the names of the executeables to comply with Debian GNU/Linux policy,
     https://www.debian.org/doc/devel-manuals#policy
   - Added Raspberry Pi support (raspbian)
   - Better JSON object parsing functions.
   - The 'Areas' tab of the GTK+ client application is now somewhat functional.
   - Added (experimental) new command 'POLL', see API.TXT.
   - Removed the need for CyaSSL and websockets system libraries,
     they are now build locally as part of the opengalaxy build process.
   - Bugfix: opengalaxy-ca: Seed the random number generator before creating a new private key.
   - Dropped support for compiling the server with OpenSSL, and moved to wolfSSL instead.
   - Certificate based client authentication now actually works :-) 
   - OpenSSL and libmysqlclient sources are no longer distributed with opengalaxy.
   - Bugfix: using 4096bit private keys for client certificates now works on both Windows and Linux.
   - Linux: Implemented strict file security for accessing the certificates,
     users need to be a member of group staff to run the server or certificates manager.
