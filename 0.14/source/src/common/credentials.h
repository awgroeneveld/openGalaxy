/*
 * Functions to encode/decode user credentials and privileges
 * into a format we can safely insert into an SSL client certificate.
 *
 * openGalaxy uses client SSL certificates to both authenticate a
 * connecting client and to store user credentials and privileges associated
 * with that client.
 *
 * OpenSSL takes care of the authentication of a client certificate but has no
 * knowledge on how to store/extract user credentials and privileges in/from a
 * certificate.
 *
 * To store credentials and privileges inside a certificate openGalaxy uses
 * the 'SAN otherName' facility of the SSL certificates to embed a base64
 * encoded JSON object containing that client's user credentials and privileges.
 *
 * The data inside the JSON object has been encrypted using a combination
 * of both RSA and AES together with an RSA signature and an
 * SHA2 message digest.
 *
 * The signature is used to verify that openGalaxy is the creator of the
 * object and the SHA2 hash is used to make sure the data is authentic.
