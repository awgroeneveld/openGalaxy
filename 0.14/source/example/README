Example usage of the MySQL database created by openGalaxy:
----------------------------------------------------------

To demonstrate displaying messages written to the MySQL database that
openGalaxy creates, a small example webinterface for installation on a
webserver (like apache2) is included in the example directory:

It is written using php5, JQuery and JQuery UI and displays decoded SIA
messages in a web browser as soon as they are written to a MySQL database.

How to set up a web server is beyond the scope of this readme, but
the files in the example directory may be copied to the 'docroot' of your
web server. The web server will need to support php5 and you'll need to
adjust the settings in 'dbconnect.php'
